**General guidelines**

---

While the following guidelines are not not to be strictly adhered to, it's highly recommended that your editing of this section remain within the parameters they provide. Always feel free to start a discussion thread to review your posts and comments on any section of this book.

This section should begin with helping the reader understand the essence of a version control system. Definition of terms is quite helpful in this section as we assume a novice encounter with the concept of source control or revision control systems. While the writer can compare and contrast with existing revision control tools, the primary focus should be on Git so as to minimize on and save the reader confusions that may arise following discrepancies.

You can go ahead and give a brief summary of your experience using Git as a source control tool, and reasons why you'd prefer its use in a given environment.
