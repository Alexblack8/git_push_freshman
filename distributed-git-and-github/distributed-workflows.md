In Git, every developer is potentially both a node and a hub and as such can both  contribute code to other repositories and maintain a public repository on which others can base their work and which they can contribute to. This opens a vast range of workflow possibilities for one's project and/or team. 

Though there are a number of paradigms that take advantage of this flexibility, only one is covered here. However, as a co-editor, feel free to include a list of other paradigms.
