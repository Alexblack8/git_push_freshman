# Contributing to the Git Push Freshman project

Many thanks for your interest in contributing to the Git Push Freshman project!

We'll spent most of our time developing an evolving open curriculum for this project. This is an e-book edited and published using <a href="https://www.gitbook.com">GitBook</a>. 

As such, efforts of technical reviewers including but not limited to project contributors and maintainers using GitHub, tech bloggers, Open Educational Resources (OER) contributors, are highly welcome in co-authoring of the curriculum.

Presented in this document is a set of guidelines to help you out in your contribution to this project, making it easy for you to get involved.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a <a href="https://github.com/ottagit/git_push_freshman/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> to be upheld for a perpetual positive environment.

## Open Curriculum

The <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/ottagit/git-push-freshman-open-curriculum/details">open curriculum</a> is the core of this project and has been made open for editing. Feel free to remix it.

## How to submit changes 

<b>N.B.</b> The open curriculum has been synchronized with <a href="https://github.com/ottagit/git_push_freshman">this repository</a>. Any changes made to the repository are automatically updated in the destination file in the git book.
